Note that zone 3 in the code is referred to as zone 0 in the paper.

full_results details:
    Data:
        Zone 1: wave 1 (ensemble var precalculated) param tests only
                waves 2 and 3, ens var and param tests
        Zone 2: All waves have ens var and param tests
                The ens var runs for this were used for zones 1 and 3.
        Zone 3: wave 1 (ensemble var precalculated) param tests only
                wave 2, ens var and param tests

    Model:
        Zone 1: wave 1 (ensemble var precalculated) param tests only
                wave 2, ens var and param tests
        Zone 2: Both waves have ens var and param tests.
                The ens var runs for this were used for zones 1 and 3.
        Zeon 3: wave 1 (ensemble var precalculated) param tests only
                wave 2, ens var and param tests

Note that the ens var calculated with zone 2 results that are used
for zones 1 and 3 did not need to be run twice as the same parameters
were used in each case. However, the results will be slightly different
so I've left it at two sets even though one would suffice.
