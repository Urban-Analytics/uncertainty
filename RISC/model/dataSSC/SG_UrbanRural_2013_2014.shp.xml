The classification is based upon two main criteria: (i) population as defined by National Records of Scotland (NRS), and (ii) accessibility based on drive time analysis to differentiate between accessible and remote areas in Scotland. The classification is available in a two, three, six or eight fold form. The two-fold classification simply distinguishes between urban and rural areas through two categories, urban and rural, while the three-fold classification splits the rural category between accessible and remote. Most commonly used is the 6-fold classification which distinguishes between urban, rural, and remote areas through six categories. The 8-fold classification further distinguishes between remote and very remote regions. The Classification is normally updated on a biennial basis, with the boundaries represented in this particular dataset reflective of the years 2013 to 2014.</idAbs><idPoC><rpIndName>Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services (RESAS)</rpIndName><rpOrgName>Scottish Government</rpOrgName><rpPosName>Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services (RESAS), Environment and Forestry</rpPosName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress><delPoint>Victoria Quay</delPoint><city>Edinburgh</city><adminArea>Scotland</adminArea><postCode>EH6 6QQ</postCode><country>GB</country><eMailAdd>RuralStatistics@scotland.gsi.gov.uk</eMailAdd></cntAddress></rpCntInfo></idPoC><idPoC><rpIndName>Geographic Information Science and Analysis Team (GI-SAT)</rpIndName><rpOrgName>Scottish Government</rpOrgName><rpPosName>Geographic Information Science and Analysis Team (GI-SAT), Digital Public Services</rpPosName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress><delPoint>Victoria Quay</delPoint><city>Edinburgh</city><adminArea>Scotland</adminArea><postCode>EH6 6QQ</postCode><country>GB</country><eMailAdd>GI-SAT@scotland.gsi.gov.uk</eMailAdd></cntAddress></rpCntInfo></idPoC><idPoC><rpIndName>Spatial Data Management Team (SDMT)</rpIndName><rpOrgName>Scottish Government</rpOrgName><rpPosName>Spatial Data Management Team (SDMT), Agriculture, Food and Rural Communities</rpPosName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress><delPoint>Saughton House, Broomhouse Drive</delPoint><city>Edinburgh</city><adminArea>Scotland</adminArea><postCode>EH11 3XD</postCode><country>GB</country><eMailAdd>SDMT@scotland.gsi.gov.uk</eMailAdd></cntAddress></rpCntInfo></idPoC><resMaint/><otherKeys><keyword>Land use</keyword><thesaName><resTitle>GEMET - INSPIRE themes, version 1.0</resTitle><date><pubDate>2008-06-01T00:00:00</pubDate></date></thesaName></otherKeys><searchKeys><keyword>Land use</keyword></searchKeys><resConst><LegConsts><othConsts>Available under the Ordnance Survey (OS) Open Data Licence (www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendata/licence)</othConsts><othConsts>The dataset has complete coverage for Scotland, and is clipped to the High Water Mark coastline (OS BoundaryLine).</othConsts><othConsts>The following attribution statement must be used to acknowledge the source of the information: Copyright Scottish Government, contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right (insert year)</othConsts></LegConsts></resConst><resConst><Consts><useLimit>OS OpenData Licence</useLimit></Consts></resConst><dataScale><equScale><rfDenom>10000</rfDenom></equScale></dataScale><dataLang><languageCode value="eng"/><countryCode value="GBR" Sync="TRUE"></countryCode></dataLang><tpCat><TopicCatCd value="016"/></tpCat><dataExt><geoEle><GeoBndBox><westBL>-9.229868</westBL><eastBL>-0.705303</eastBL><southBL>54.513372</southBL><northBL>60.866111</northBL></GeoBndBox></geoEle><geoEle><GeoDesc><geoId><identAuth><resTitle>ISO 3166-2</resTitle><date><reviseDate>2007-12-13T00:00:00</reviseDate></date></identAuth><identCode>SCT</identCode></geoId></GeoDesc></geoEle><tempEle><TempExtent><exTemp/></TempExtent></tempEle></dataExt><suppInfo>http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/About/Methodology/UrbanRuralClassification</suppInfo><envirDesc Sync="TRUE">Microsoft Windows 7 Version 6.1 (Build 7601) Service Pack 1; ESRI ArcGIS 10.0.5.4400</envirDesc><spatRpType><SpatRepTypCd value="001" Sync="TRUE"></SpatRepTypCd></spatRpType><dataExt><geoEle><GeoBndBox esriExtentType="search"><exTypeCode Sync="TRUE">1</exTypeCode><westBL Sync="TRUE">-9.229868</westBL><eastBL Sync="TRUE">-0.705303</eastBL><northBL Sync="TRUE">60.866111</northBL><southBL Sync="TRUE">54.513372</southBL></GeoBndBox></geoEle></dataExt></dataIdInfo><distInfo><distFormat><formatName>ESRI Arc/View Shapefile</formatName><formatVer>10.0</formatVer></distFormat><distFormat><formatName>WMS</formatName><formatVer>1.3.0</formatVer></distFormat><distTranOps><onLineSrc><linkage>http://sedsh127.sedsh.gov.uk/Atom_data/ScotGov/LandUse/SG_LandUse.atom.en.xml</linkage><protocol/><orName>Scottish Government Land Use Download Service (ATOM Feed)</orName></onLineSrc><onLineSrc><linkage>http://sedsh127.sedsh.gov.uk/arcgis/services/ScotGov/LandUse/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&amp;service=WMS</linkage></onLineSrc><transSize Sync="TRUE">26.310</transSize></distTranOps></distInfo><dqInfo><dqScope/><dataLineage><statement>The Scottish Government Urban/Rural Classification was created by combining population and accessibility information to distinguish between urban and rural areas across Scotland. Population information is sourced from the Settlements dataset provided by National Records of Scotland (NRS), and accessibility information is obtained by calculating drive times from the centres of Settlements with a population of 10,000 or more (i.e. urban areas). Datasets used to create the classification are as follows: • Scottish Settlement boundaries, centroids and population estimates 2012 (NRS, 2014) • English Settlement centroids for populations of 10,000 or more (i.e. Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle, sourced from OS 50K Gazetteer) • Integrated Transport Network (ITN) for Scotland and major routes for Northern England (OS MasterMap and Strategi, 2014) • Scottish Vehicular Ferry Routes (Scottish Government, 2014) • High and Low Water Mark Coastline Boundary (OS BoundaryLine, 2014). Settlements define the built-up areas in Scotland that are generally more identifiable as the traditional towns and cities than administrative boundaries such as Council areas, much of which consists of land that is not developed and unpopulated. For more information on how Settlements are defined, see the NRS website at http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/. Settlement centroids for Carlisle and Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northern England were also included in the analysis as they have populations of over 10,000 and are within a 30 minute drive of the Scottish border, and thus may influence accessibility results. These centroids were obtained from the Ordnance Survey's 50K Gazetteer and adjusted slightly such that they fall along the road network. For the calculation of drive times, a network dataset representing the transport network in Scotland was created. Required inputs for the transport network were the Integrated Transport Network (ITN) for Scotland, Major Roads for Northern England, and vehicular ferry routes in Scotland. ITN is the definitive, most accurate and up to date geographic reference for Great Britain's road structure, and is provided by the Ordnance Survey (OS) as part of their MasterMap product. The ITN dataset used in this analysis also included a 10 kilometre buffer into Northern England. Major routes in Northern England were also required as drive times from English settlements may affect accessibility in the border regions of Scotland. These were sourced from the OS Strategi dataset (Motorways, A Roads, and Primary Routes), and some very minor edits were performed to ensure that the Strategi routes linked up to ITN roads. A further input to the transport netwrok were Scottish Vehicular Ferry Routes. The Ferry Route dataset was created by the Scottish Government by surveying online timetables and maps from the individual service providers (both private and subsidised). Routes were digitised against Ordnance Survey background mapping. Lastly, the High and Low Water Mark Coastline boundary originates from the OS BoundaryLine product and was used to clip the final datasets. The first stage in creating the classification was to categorise the Settlements dataset using the population thresholds of 125,000, 10,000 and 3,000 to identify those settlements from which drive times will be calculated. Settlements were grouped into the following categories: (1) Large Urban Areas - populations of 125,000 or more (2) Other Urban Areas - populations of 10,000 to 124,999 (3) Small Towns - populations of 3,000 to 9,999 (4) Rural Areas - populations less than 3,000 The next step was to distinguish between accessible and remote areas. This was done by calculating a 30 minute drive time from the population weighted centroid of Settlements with a population of 10,000 or more (i.e. Large and Other Urban Areas, and including the two settlements in northern England of Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle). For the 8-fold Urban/Rural Classification, an additional 60 minute drive time was also calculated. Thus, the following definitions of remoteness were defined: (1) Accessible - Areas within a 30 minute drive time of a Settlement with a population of 10,000 or more. (2) Remote - Areas that are more than a 30 minute drive time (6-fold classification), or areas that have a drive time between 30 and 60 minutes (8-fold classification) from a Settlement with a population of 10,000 or more. (3) Very Remote - Areas that are more than a 60 minute drive time from a Settlement with a population of 10,000 or more (8-fold classification only). The drive time analysis was performed using the specialist GIS (Geographic Information System) software, ESRI ArcGIS Network Analyst Extension. Firstly, a network dataset was built from the road and ferry networks, and each road type was classified by an average speed (shown below). Settlement boundaries identified whether the rural or urban speed was applied. For example, motorways would have been assigned an average speed of 104.6 kph in rural areas, and 70.8 kph in urban (built up) areas. The speeds for each road type are the average for that class but it should be noted that the process does not take into account peak and non-peak travel times. • Motorway: 104.6 kmph (Rural), 70.8 kmph (Urban) • A Road: 64.4 kmph (Rural), 30.6 kmph (Urban) • B Road: 54.7 kmph (Rural), 25.8 kmph (Urban) • Minor and Local Road: 40.2 kmph (Rural), 22.5 kmph (Urban) • Alley: 40.2 kmph (Rural), 22.5 kmph (Urban) • Pedestrian Road: 0 kmph (Rural), 0 kmph (Urban) • Private Road – Publicly accessible: 40.2 kmph (Rural), 22.5 kmph (Urban) • Private Road: 40.2 kmph (Rural), 22.5 kmph (Urban) • Ferry:15 kmph (Rural), 15 kmph (Urban) Once the road/ferry network dataset had been created and reclassified in terms of average speeds, the drive time analysis could be calculated from those settlements with a population of 10,000 or more. Outputs of the analysis were boundary extents of both 30 and 60 minute drive time. Each settlement was initially classed depending on its estimated population, but with the creation of the drive time extent layers, they were further classified in terms of accessibility. Accessibility categories were assigned to the settlement boundary layer based upon the location of the settlements’ population weighted centroid. Classifying the settlements by their centroids means that the entire settlement will be assigned to a single class, regardless of whether the area is split by the drive time extent boundary. Combining both the population and accessibility measures, a Scotland-wide Urban Rural Classification is defined. The 6-fold classification distinguishes between urban, rural and remote areas by the following categories: (1) Large Urban Areas - Settlements of 125,000 people and over. (2) Other Urban Areas - Settlements of 10,000 to 124,999 people. (3) Accessible Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and within a 30 minute drive time of a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (4) Remote Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and with a drive time of over 30 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (5) Accessible Rural Areas – Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and within a 30 minute drive time of a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (6) Remote Rural Areas - Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and with a drive time of over 30 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. An 8-fold classification is also defined, which distinguishes between Remote and Very Remote areas by the addition of a 60 minute drive time threshold. The categories for the 8-fold classification are as follows: (1) Large Urban Areas - Settlements of 125,000 people and over. (2) Other Urban Areas - Settlements of 10,000 to 124,999 people. (3) Accessible Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and within a 30 minute drive time of a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (4) Remote Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and with a drive time of over 30 minutes but less than or equal to 60 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (5) Very Remote Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and with a drive time of over 60 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (6) Accessible Rural Areas - Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and within a drive time of 30 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (7) Remote Rural Areas - Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and with a drive time of over 30 minutes but less than or equal to 60 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (8) Very Remote Rural Areas - Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and with a drive time of over 60 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more.</statement></dataLineage></dqInfo><Binary><Enclosure><Descript>original metadata</Descript><Data SourceMetadata="yes" OriginalFileName="source_metadata.xml" SourceMetadataDigest="ac4d1227801e0695a050adaf9d2e1e" EsriPropertyType="Base64" SourceMetadataSchema="iso19139" SourceMetadataDocId="564db46c-3153-423c-ac84-90d41ec2652c">PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0idXRmLTgiPz4NCjxnbWQ6TURfTWV0YWRhdGEg

				<gmd:abstract>
					<gco:CharacterString>The Scottish Government (SG) Urban Rural Classification provides a consistent way of defining urban and rural areas across Scotland. The classification is based upon two main criteria: (i) population as defined by National Records of Scotland (NRS), and (ii) accessibility based on drive time analysis to differentiate between accessible and remote areas in Scotland. The classification is available in a two, three, six or eight fold form. The two-fold classification simply distinguishes between urban and rural areas through two categories, urban and rural, while the three-fold classification splits the rural category between accessible and remote. Most commonly used is the 6-fold classification which distinguishes between urban, rural, and remote areas through six categories. The 8-fold classification further distinguishes between remote and very remote regions. The Classification is normally updated on a biennial basis, with the boundaries represented in this particular dataset reflective of the years 2013 to 2014.</gco:CharacterString>

							<gco:CharacterString>The Scottish Government Urban/Rural Classification was created by combining population and accessibility information to distinguish between urban and rural areas across Scotland. Population information is sourced from the Settlements dataset provided by National Records of Scotland (NRS), and accessibility information is obtained by calculating drive times from the centres of Settlements with a population of 10,000 or more (i.e. urban areas). Datasets used to create the classification are as follows: • Scottish Settlement boundaries, centroids and population estimates 2012 (NRS, 2014) • English Settlement centroids for populations of 10,000 or more (i.e. Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle, sourced from OS 50K Gazetteer) • Integrated Transport Network (ITN) for Scotland and major routes for Northern England (OS MasterMap and Strategi, 2014) • Scottish Vehicular Ferry Routes (Scottish Government, 2014) • High and Low Water Mark Coastline Boundary (OS BoundaryLine, 2014). Settlements define the built-up areas in Scotland that are generally more identifiable as the traditional towns and cities than administrative boundaries such as Council areas, much of which consists of land that is not developed and unpopulated. For more information on how Settlements are defined, see the NRS website at http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/. Settlement centroids for Carlisle and Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northern England were also included in the analysis as they have populations of over 10,000 and are within a 30 minute drive of the Scottish border, and thus may influence accessibility results. These centroids were obtained from the Ordnance Survey's 50K Gazetteer and adjusted slightly such that they fall along the road network. For the calculation of drive times, a network dataset representing the transport network in Scotland was created. Required inputs for the transport network were the Integrated Transport Network (ITN) for Scotland, Major Roads for Northern England, and vehicular ferry routes in Scotland. ITN is the definitive, most accurate and up to date geographic reference for Great Britain's road structure, and is provided by the Ordnance Survey (OS) as part of their MasterMap product. The ITN dataset used in this analysis also included a 10 kilometre buffer into Northern England. Major routes in Northern England were also required as drive times from English settlements may affect accessibility in the border regions of Scotland. These were sourced from the OS Strategi dataset (Motorways, A Roads, and Primary Routes), and some very minor edits were performed to ensure that the Strategi routes linked up to ITN roads. A further input to the transport netwrok were Scottish Vehicular Ferry Routes. The Ferry Route dataset was created by the Scottish Government by surveying online timetables and maps from the individual service providers (both private and subsidised). Routes were digitised against Ordnance Survey background mapping. Lastly, the High and Low Water Mark Coastline boundary originates from the OS BoundaryLine product and was used to clip the final datasets. The first stage in creating the classification was to categorise the Settlements dataset using the population thresholds of 125,000, 10,000 and 3,000 to identify those settlements from which drive times will be calculated. Settlements were grouped into the following categories: (1) Large Urban Areas - populations of 125,000 or more (2) Other Urban Areas - populations of 10,000 to 124,999 (3) Small Towns - populations of 3,000 to 9,999 (4) Rural Areas - populations less than 3,000 The next step was to distinguish between accessible and remote areas. This was done by calculating a 30 minute drive time from the population weighted centroid of Settlements with a population of 10,000 or more (i.e. Large and Other Urban Areas, and including the two settlements in northern England of Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle). For the 8-fold Urban/Rural Classification, an additional 60 minute drive time was also calculated. Thus, the following definitions of remoteness were defined: (1) Accessible - Areas within a 30 minute drive time of a Settlement with a population of 10,000 or more. (2) Remote - Areas that are more than a 30 minute drive time (6-fold classification), or areas that have a drive time between 30 and 60 minutes (8-fold classification) from a Settlement with a population of 10,000 or more. (3) Very Remote - Areas that are more than a 60 minute drive time from a Settlement with a population of 10,000 or more (8-fold classification only). The drive time analysis was performed using the specialist GIS (Geographic Information System) software, ESRI ArcGIS Network Analyst Extension. Firstly, a network dataset was built from the road and ferry networks, and each road type was classified by an average speed (shown below). Settlement boundaries identified whether the rural or urban speed was applied. For example, motorways would have been assigned an average speed of 104.6 kph in rural areas, and 70.8 kph in urban (built up) areas. The speeds for each road type are the average for that class but it should be noted that the process does not take into account peak and non-peak travel times. • Motorway: 104.6 kmph (Rural), 70.8 kmph (Urban) • A Road: 64.4 kmph (Rural), 30.6 kmph (Urban) • B Road: 54.7 kmph (Rural), 25.8 kmph (Urban) • Minor and Local Road: 40.2 kmph (Rural), 22.5 kmph (Urban) • Alley: 40.2 kmph (Rural), 22.5 kmph (Urban) • Pedestrian Road: 0 kmph (Rural), 0 kmph (Urban) • Private Road – Publicly accessible: 40.2 kmph (Rural), 22.5 kmph (Urban) • Private Road: 40.2 kmph (Rural), 22.5 kmph (Urban) • Ferry:15 kmph (Rural), 15 kmph (Urban) Once the road/ferry network dataset had been created and reclassified in terms of average speeds, the drive time analysis could be calculated from those settlements with a population of 10,000 or more. Outputs of the analysis were boundary extents of both 30 and 60 minute drive time. Each settlement was initially classed depending on its estimated population, but with the creation of the drive time extent layers, they were further classified in terms of accessibility. Accessibility categories were assigned to the settlement boundary layer based upon the location of the settlements’ population weighted centroid. Classifying the settlements by their centroids means that the entire settlement will be assigned to a single class, regardless of whether the area is split by the drive time extent boundary. Combining both the population and accessibility measures, a Scotland-wide Urban Rural Classification is defined. The 6-fold classification distinguishes between urban, rural and remote areas by the following categories: (1) Large Urban Areas - Settlements of 125,000 people and over. (2) Other Urban Areas - Settlements of 10,000 to 124,999 people. (3) Accessible Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and within a 30 minute drive time of a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (4) Remote Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and with a drive time of over 30 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (5) Accessible Rural Areas – Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and within a 30 minute drive time of a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (6) Remote Rural Areas - Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and with a drive time of over 30 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. An 8-fold classification is also defined, which distinguishes between Remote and Very Remote areas by the addition of a 60 minute drive time threshold. The categories for the 8-fold classification are as follows: (1) Large Urban Areas - Settlements of 125,000 people and over. (2) Other Urban Areas - Settlements of 10,000 to 124,999 people. (3) Accessible Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and within a 30 minute drive time of a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (4) Remote Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and with a drive time of over 30 minutes but less than or equal to 60 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (5) Very Remote Small Towns - Settlements of 3,000 to 9,999 people, and with a drive time of over 60 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (6) Accessible Rural Areas - Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and within a drive time of 30 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (7) Remote Rural Areas - Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and with a drive time of over 30 minutes but less than or equal to 60 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more. (8) Very Remote Rural Areas - Areas with a population of less than 3,000 people, and with a drive time of over 60 minutes to a Settlement of 10,000 or more.</gco:CharacterString>
